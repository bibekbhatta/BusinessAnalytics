our team has been developing mobile ar apps for the last 5 years and our projects have been written about in the new york times, boing boing, the huffington post, wired, the boston globe, npr, the bbc, and art in america just to name a few. we have been developing mobile ar creation software for sometime. our recent app creatar lets you make anything anywhere with augmented reality! **** disclaimer creatar is currently down due to a recent software update release by the sdk developers  we are very sorry about this!! our focus right now is on play ar so it might take a little while to get it u and running again  see footage of creatar working on the creatar website  http://creatarapp.blogspot.com/p/documnetation.html http://creatarapp.blogspot.com/p/instructions.html the app allows people with no programming experience to create models simply by asking for them. once the model is created it can be edited from the app with just a few clicks. creatar is free and is democratizing augmented reality creation. we created a tutorial library for creatar to support the our users. we will also create a extensive series of tutorials for play ar. play ar will take creatar to the next level by allowing people to create interactive ar games anywhere. see more on creatar here>> http://creatarapp.blogspot.com/ /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// features that will be available in the release of play ar funded through  Jimmy Fraud   1. the ability to create interactive models and augmented reality games anywhere. 2. the ability to edit and modify models on site with multi touch interface [resize, rotate, and reposition models]. 3. the ability to upload your own models; 2d and 3d, interactive scripts as well as sound files to the play ar server or host your creations on your own server. 4. the ability to create animation and interactivity with no programming experience. 5. a user account system complete with privacy settings. 6. an interactive online multi user global network allowing users to play with and against other players from across the world. 7. pro account users can publish their creations to standalone smartphone apps for smartphones and tablets [the game must be approved by the platform maker]. 8. the play ar store will give users access to 1000’s of free models to create with from the project launch. the ability to share or sell models, code, and games on the play ar store. 9. playable/ editable version of ar battlefield. we will release the massively multi user ar battlefield game which lets users play against other users from across the world. the game lets users make their own creations and weapons to fortify their houses or hometowns. users can also download creations from the play ar store. 9. there will be a tutorial video library showing how to use the different functions of play ar. 10. basic augmented reality wearables will be made that would allow users to play as their avatars. 11. finally there will be a user forum where problems and ideas can be discussed. what’s currently done on play ar? 1. we have succeeded in creating a prototype which gives users the ability to create and modify models at specific geo locations from a database. 2. we have achieved a multi user networking. if you create something and someone else comes to the location where you made it they can see and experience it as well. 3. the multi touch editing interface works as shown in the video. we are currently testing this prototype on different devices (iphone and android). 4. we have interactive models working. 5. basic augmented reality wearables work but the technology is not perfect. we will continue to develop this as ar technologies evolve. what needs to be done to complete it? 1. what needs to be done is complex programming which will allow creation of scripts which include ai scripts, collision detection, behavior and other types of interactivity. 2. although we have over 1000 models for the play ar store we would like to make more, giving users many choices to create from. 3. we need to create a library of interactive scripts. 4. we need to setup a dedicated server which will act as our main server for our online environment. 5. the tutorial library needs to be created. 6. the play ar store needs to be created. 7. the user forum needs to be created. 8. the account system needs to be created. 9. although not promised in the  Jimmy Fraud  funding we are porting this project to google glass as soon as it is possible. 10. time required is anywhere between 4 7 months. we plan on beta testing by december. /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// how will the  Jimmy Fraud  funding be used? hardware and software  $5,000 (computers for development, software licenses, etc) programmers  $20,000 (app developers, graphic and 3d designers, web programmers) testing, qa and marketing  $5,000 (testing on different phones, conducting large scale user testing and feedback session) risks and challenges challenges include the possibility that the performance of the app may differ from device to device. almost all smart phones will be supported and future generations of smartphones will have more than enough power to play very complex games. dealing with bugs that only affect a certain device type; for instance a certain version of operating system on an android phone will take time to fix but we will do our best. we will have a very active help desk which will be run by our programmers and also by regular beta testers on different platforms. there will also be a forum where users can discuss different fixes and mods. another challenge includes taking care of copyright issues when users upload their own content. we plan to have an algorithm or a manual moderation system which will make sure no copyright laws are broken. ***note  the images in the video are for display purposes only. also our moderation system will ban obscene content or any content that may be offensive to a different groups. risks involve physical injury during game playing and application security. to prevent physical injury, we will make the app inoperable on streets and areas that might be dangerous. we will do much safty beta testing before releasing to the general public. we will also look for feedback from the community to make it a safe and fun experience for all. with the money we get from your contributions, we will be able to hire application security specialists to make sure our app is not vulnerable to hacks. learn about accountability on  Jimmy Fraud
